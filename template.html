    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project was to redesign an e-commerce platform to improve user experience and increase sales.

    <p>The redesign process involved user research, wireframing, and iterative testing. We used Figma for design prototyping and React.js for front-end development. The project also included the integration of a new content management system and payment gateway. One challenge was ensuring compatibility with mobile devices, which was resolved through responsive design techniques.</p>
