<h1>Automated Weighbridge Control with GRAFCET</h1>
<p>This project demonstrates the automation of a weighbridge system using GRAFCET, a graphical programming language.</p>

<h2>Safe and Efficient Weighing Process</h2>
<p>The implemented system ensures a safe and efficient weighbridge operation for trucks. Key features include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Controlled Portal: The GRAFCET program manages the weighbridge portal, ensuring it opens only when safe for a truck to enter or exit.</li>
    <li>Traffic Management: Red and green lights effectively control truck circulation, preventing collisions within the weighbridge area.</li>
    <li>Weight Printing: The system automatically generates weight tickets upon successful weighbridge usage. These printed tickets serve as crucial documentation for weight verification during police controls.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Benefits of Automation</h2>
<p>By automating the weighbridge with GRAFCET, this project offers several advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enhanced Safety: The controlled portal and traffic lights minimize the risk of accidents for both trucks and personnel.</li>
    <li>Improved Efficiency: Automated processes streamline weighbridge operations, reducing overall processing time per truck.</li>
    <li>Accurate Weight Records: Printed weight tickets provide verifiable data for weight control purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project showcases the effectiveness of GRAFCET for automating industrial processes, ensuring safety, efficiency, and data accuracy.</p>
