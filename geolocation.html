<h1>Real-Time People Counting in Confined Spaces</h1>
<h2>A Project by SEE Telecom</h2>

<p>This project tackles a critical challenge in confined environments like tunnels and metro stations: ensuring real-time awareness of occupant numbers.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Emergency Response</h2>
<p>Imagine an accident within a tunnel or metro station. Knowing the exact number of people inside becomes crucial for first responders. This project aims to provide that crucial information.</p>
<p>By implementing a people-counting system, emergency services can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Deploy resources efficiently based on the number of people potentially affected.</li>
    <li>Coordinate evacuation efforts more effectively.</li>
    <li>Improve overall response times during emergencies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technology for Safety</h2>
<p>This project explores various technologies for accurate people counting, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Camera-based systems: Utilizing image recognition or thermal imaging to detect people entering and exiting confined spaces.</li>
    <li>Sensor-based systems: Employing sensors like LiDAR or infrared to track movement and estimate occupancy.</li>
    <li>Data integration: Combining data from multiple sources for enhanced accuracy and redundancy.</li>
    </p></ul>

    <h2>SEE Telecom - Advancing Safety Solutions</h2>
    <p>SEE Telecom is committed to developing innovative solutions that improve safety in confined spaces. This people-counting project represents our dedication to creating technology that empowers first responders and safeguards lives.</p>
