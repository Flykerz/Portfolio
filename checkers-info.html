<h1>Checkers - A Fun and Strategic Game</h1>
<p>Checkers is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 checkered board with diagonally alternating dark and light squares. The objective is to capture all your opponent's pieces or render them unable to move.</p>
<h2>How to Play Checkers</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Each player starts with 12 pieces of their color (usually black and red) placed on the dark squares of the first three rows closest to them.</li>
    <li>Pieces can only move diagonally one square forward, onto an empty light square.</li>
    <li>If a piece lands on the opponent's furthest row (opposite side of the board), it becomes a "king." A king can move diagonally one or two squares forward.</li>
    <li>When a player has the opportunity to jump over an opponent's piece (landing on an empty square diagonally two squares beyond), they must do so (capturing the jumped piece). Multiple jumps are allowed in a single turn if possible.</li>
    <li>The game ends when one player loses all their pieces or can no longer move any remaining pieces.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bringing Checkers to Life with C#</h2>
<p>I have developed a checkers game in C#. It implements the core gameplay mechanics, including piece movement, capturing, kinging, and turn management. This allows you to play checkers virtually against the computer or another player.</p>
<p>While you can't play the game directly on this webpage, the C# code provides a fun and interactive way to experience the classic game of checkers.</p>
