<h1> Terrain Rouge </h1>
<h2>The Web App for Collaborative Music Playlists at Polytech Nancy</h2>
<p>This project is a creation of a 4th-year engineering student.</p>

<h2>From Static Playlists to Collaborative Fun</h2>
<p>
    During Polytech Nancy's student association events, playlists are used to set the musical mood. But wouldn't it be even better if everyone could contribute?
</p>
<p>
    Introducing Terrain Rouge, a web application designed to revolutionize event playlists! It allows for collaborative creation, ensuring everyone's musical preferences are heard.
</p>

<h2>Shape the Soundscape of Your Events</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Open to All Polytech Nancy Students:  Create an account and join the music-making fun!</li>
    <li>Collaborative Playlist Creation: Suggest songs and vote for your favorites for each event. </li>
    <li>Event-Specific Playlists: Karaoke nights, rock concerts, astronomy evenings - you name it, Terrain Rouge has it covered!</li>
    <li>Democratized Choice: The event creator sets the deadline and maximum song limit, ensuring a diverse and voted-upon final playlist. </li>
    <li>Export with Ease: Once the event is over, the finalized playlist can be exported to your preferred streaming platform!</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Name's Inspiration: The "Terrain Rouge"</h2>
<p>
    The name "Terrain Rouge" (Red Floor) pays homage to the well-trodden dance floor where countless Polytech Nancy events and concerts take place. It embodies the energy and spirit of student life!
</p>

<p>The project is currently under development, with a target launch date of September 2024 for all Polytech Nancy students. Get ready to rock your favorite events with collaboratively chosen music!</p>
